: Table 1: Features description

```{r}
toyota <- read_csv("data/toyota.csv")

toyota %>% 
  skim_without_charts()

toyota %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 20)

# Changing column names to snake case

toyota <- toyota %>% 
  clean_names()
```

## Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
# Function to plot numerical and categorical

```

### Distribution of price

```{r}
toyota %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price))+
  geom_histogram(color = "white")

# Log transformation on price 
toyota %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price))+
  geom_histogram(color = "White")+
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10")
```

The distribution of price is not normal, so a log 10  transformation may be needed in order to get more accurate results, so now on we are going to work with the log of the price.

```{r}
toyota <- toyota %>% 
  mutate(price_log10 = log10(price))
```

### Comparing price across categories

#### Price across the diferent car models

```{r}
toyota %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price, y = fct_reorder(model,price)))+
  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = T)+
  scale_x_log10()
```
