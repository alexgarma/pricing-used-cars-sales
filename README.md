- Analyzing data for a used cars retailer to develop a model that could estimate with precision the price of cars that arrive at the dealership to improve sales.

## Results ⚙️

- The result was an XGBoost model with 93% of testing observations in the desired range. I presented findings to an industry data scientist and other judges, making results understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences.
